Rule: All UI text (buttons, headers, guidance) must adhere to a "Spiritual, Calming, Encouraging, and Concise" tone.

Rule: Avoid technical jargon. Use words like "Guidance," "Journey," "Witness," and "Flow" rather than "Instructions," "Dashboard," "Monitor," or "Execute."

Reasoning: The text must reinforce the visual atmosphere. A glowing, spiritual card shouldn't have bureaucratic text.
